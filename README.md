# The Feline Order(had to pay a tribute to the cats in some way)
## Please read this ReadMe


I initially thought app was supposed to be about cats but the API did not have any cat pictures so I made it about Star Wars Characters(so the API could be used since it was a requirement).
Because of the pictures situation I wrote a python script to download all the images for each character, so that the app would work as intended. However, I do know how to show an image from the web in an ios app with just a link being provided, I just could not really do it in this app since the pictures the API had were pictures of random things.




Extra Credit Features:
- I made sure that the app would work with both iPad and iPhone.
- Dark Mode Support
- Used an animation when showing the Detail View.




Extra Features/Ideas that I believe will make me stand out:

- Added a learn more button to each detail screen so that the user can access information about the character from within the app itself.
- I used native solutions(using URLSession instead of Alamofire for example) as well as third party ones(SwiftyJSON) to show that I have domination in both aspects.
- Made sure to make my own design for the app so that it would look as appealing and beautiful as possible.
- Coded the app entirely in SwiftUI which was the preferred framework.
